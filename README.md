Every year I try to trick myself into thinking I'll finish AOC this year

Why not try to trick myself again?

This time, I'll be doing it in Haskell, since I've always wanted to try it
out.

It's another year of using another functional programming language.
But who knows, maybe I'll actually learn something new.

Probably not.
